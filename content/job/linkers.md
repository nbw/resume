<label>What I did</label>

<p>Working as a Ruby on Rails developer on an app focused on bridging the gap between Japanese companies, financial institutions, and banks.  Multi-tenant database architecture (using Apartment gem) to connect institutions.</p>
<p>Currently I’m also the backend lead for renewing the entire frontend stack (into Vuejs), which requires porting into an API focused design.</p>
<p>Cool perk of the job: Yukihiro Matsumoto (the creator of Ruby) joins our study meetings once a month. </p>
