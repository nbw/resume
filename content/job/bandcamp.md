<label>What I did</label>

<p>
	As part of the support team at Bandcamp, my primary role was to interact with artists and fans concerning problems with the site.
</p>

<p>
	The job itself was quite technically demanding. For example, handrolling and executing raw SQL queries to retrieve stats and info.  I also had the chance to code admin tools and a few front facing pages.
</p>

<p>
	Tasks included:
	<ul>
		<li>Answering emails (we used FogBugz, now called Manuscript)</li>
		<li>Refining website documentation</li>
		<li>Cataloging issues (if there's a problem, you gotta prove it)</li>
		<li>Coding new admin tools and features to improve some of the more repetative parts of support</li>
	</ul>
</p>
