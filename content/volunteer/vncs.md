Primarly been involved with modifying [VNCS](http://vncs.ca/)'s website to support online registration and payment. Up until that point membership was accomplished in-person or by mail, which is still the case for most other Japanese Canadian groups across Canada including Vancouver.

Additionally helping at numerous events, like Obon matsuri.
