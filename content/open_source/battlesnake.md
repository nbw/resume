[Battlesnake](https://play.battlesnake.io/) is a competition where participants create an AI snake bot and compete in a tournament. In 2019, the competition had over 400+ participants.

> "Build your programming skills by writing AI snake bots using modern, real-world technology and compete to be the last snake slithering."

The project is based out of Victoria and so I had an opportunity to be involved. We met on a bi-weekly basis and chipped away at issues over the year.

My contributions were mostly on [Engine](https://github.com/battlesnakeio/engine) (Golang; game business logic) and [Board](https://github.com/battlesnakeio/board) (Javascript; SVGs on the game board).
