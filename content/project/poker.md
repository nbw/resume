An agile poker tool I wrote to replace the free tool we used at work (which kept crashing).

+ Written in Elixir
+ No database!
+ Utilizes Phoenix Channels (websockets), LiveView (real-time ssr), and Phoenix Presence (process tracking)
+ English and Japanese

[Try it here](https://agile-poka.herokuapp.com/)

(Heroku app is sleepy, so give it 20 seconds to wake up)
