  <p>Contributing a community is important. I've been luck enough to be involved with <a href="https://battlesnake.io">Battlesnake</a>, but I've also thrown up the odd pull-request for a few other projects too.</p>
	<ul>
	  {{ range .Data.Pages }}
	    {{ if eq .Type "open_source" }}
	    	{{ partial "open_source" . }}
	    {{ end }}
	  {{ end }}
	</ul>
